//! Extract data from the HTTP request.
//!
//! The [`Extract`] trait is implemented by types that can be constructed by
//! using data from an HTTP request. Resource method argument types must
//! implement [`Extract`]. This is how `impl_web!` is able to instantiate them
//! using the request. See [library level][lib] documentation for more details.
//!
//! Currently, [`Extract`] implementations are provided for the following types:
//!
//! * [`Bytes`](https://docs.rs/bytes/0.4/bytes/struct.Bytes.html)
//! * [`Option`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html)
//! * [`PathBuf`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/path/struct.PathBuf.html)
//! * [`String`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html)
//! * [`Vec<u8>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html)
//!
//! More implementations can be added by submitting a PR.
//!
//! Also, [`Extract`] can be implemented for custom types by using the
//! [`derive(Extract)`] proc macro. See [library level][lib] documentation for
//! more details.
